        <h2>Around town</h2>
        
        <p>Las Matas is a small town, compared to the big cities in the country, but as a municiple section, is quite big. </p>
        <p>It has 5 sub-municiple areas, well defined by their legal physical bounderies, but these lines blurry when it comes to culture. You can't tell a resident of one sub-municipality from the other.</p>
        <p>These <a href="municipalities.html">municipalities</a> are:</p>

        <p>The city of Las Matas de Santa Cruz is located to the north of the Dominican Republic side of La Espanola island, and it's the largest of city in the Montecristi province. It's a beautiful and fruitful parte of the region known as The North West Region, where inmense portions of land are used primarily to grow rice, our main source of income.</p>
        
       <!--<h2>MORE ABOUT</h2>-->

        <p>The center of Las Matas is divided by the  Calle Duarte (Duarte Street), which connects the town with The Capital to the East and on the other side with other towns to West. To both sides of Duarte street there are houses of vary colors and sizes. Anyone coming in from either end of the street will be treated to a beautiful hue of little wooden castles.</p> 

        <p>One staple feature about Las Matas are dogs, cats, and birds running around the town. Some are wild, some are domesticated by the people. These animals are loved here, and rarely you see any animal suffering in town.</p>
        
        <p>Flowers are also seen in Las Matas, where they become part of life. Every morning, when the town wakes up, the first order of the day is to irrigate these plants. "<em>They're alive</em>," my aunt says. "<em>And if you talk to them, they will understand you. If you hurt them, they'll feel it.</em>" I'm not interested on finding out if this is true. </p>
