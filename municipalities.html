        <p>There's only one main road, Duarte Street. </p>
        <p>This municipalities are not that far from each other. Anyone could walk the distance between them in less than a day</p>
        <p>There are places in Las Matas where no one lives. It's vacated land. These lands belong to rich people from outside of town.</p>
        <p>These municipalities are:</p>

        <h3>Las Matas (Main)</h3>
        
        <p>This is the center of the town, where the bigger park and small stores are. Business is fluent here, and groups of people gather to talk about the latest ocurrences and news. This part of town is surrounded by the main canal to the North; Barrio Lindo to the South; and to the Southwest, the deep wood and the road to Montecristi. Through the middle, Las Matas is crossed by The Main Road, Duarte Street.  </p>

        <h3>Manga Mocha</h3>
        
        <p>On the other side of The Canal, lying down on a dry and vast land, is Manga Mocha. This part of town is very small, but the Main River runs still through it, giving it certain importance for the people. Crops of rice could be seen going on here in certain parts of the year.</p>

        <h3>El Bolsillo</h3>
        
        El Bolsillo is a dead part of town where nothing ever happens. Dry, far from civilization, the world tend to forget about it until, rarely, something happens, like a death of a dweller or a flying horse seen gravitaring by the morning lights. It's here where the only cemetery of Las Matas is located.

        <h3>Barrio Lindo</h3>
        
        <p>El Bolsillo is the happy place of all of Las Matas. This is where all the escapades happen at night, when men from all over the region come to get happy at the hands of the putas alegres de la tarde. No few encounters between this ladies and the wives of the visiting men have happened, leaving a sour taste and some garrotazos on the backs of the unfortunate men looking to forget in those house of glory the monotony of their lives at home.</p>
